I'm Kasinath K S from "CSE-D". I live in (hosteler) Thiruvalla, a town in Pathanamthitta,Kerala.
    In amFOSS , I'm interested about the club's participation and involvement in other popular problem solving and idea competitions.
    From the presentation "introduction to the club", one part which attracted me towards the club was about the participation of Club in the "Google Summer of Code". I personally want to be a part of it.
    My major interest is in the field of problem solving and after that it is in open source contribution.So , I think amFOSS is the best castle for me.
